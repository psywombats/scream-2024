PAL: "YOU! You finally made it."
YOU: "Hey everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting. I was up all last night preparing for my thesis defense."
LEADER: "That's tomorrow?"
YOU: "Yep. Dr. Mehta says I've got it in the bag though. I mean, the freaking Discovey Channel wants to interview me. The committee would be crazy to fail me now. It'd make A&M look bad."
JERK: "Congratulations, YOU. Your hard work paid off."
YOU: "Thanks, JERK. I really appreciated everyone's support, and yours especially. I had an expert to cite about the new species' habitat."
JERK: "That's what friends are for. No problem whatsoever."
LEADER: "You're coming to the party tomorrow, right?"
YOU: "Hopefully! I can't wait to meet Professor Stejneger."
LEADER: "And he can't wait to meet me, and all of you. The whole National Caving Society's going to be there."
JERK: "They've certainly taken a shine to you."
LEADER: "Don't be humble, JERK. They're really happy to have a real scientist like you on board instead of just amateur thrill junkies like me and PAL."
PAL: "They'll let me tag along on trips and won't make me pay dues. That's basically all I need to be happy."
CONTROL: "You guys need to convince them to take Bitsy along too. Okay, PAL?"
PAL: "I'll see what I can do. LEADER's gonna need to convince them."
CONTROL: "Spelonky's going super, but just imagine what I could do if I had data on caves from all over the world."
CONTROL: "YOU, you need to get me your Steam username. I'll send you over a beta key!"
YOU: "You're going to sell the game?"
CONTROL: "I'm going indie for now, but a publisher's been in touch. I'm holding out for more revenue share, honestly. These guys just have bad vibes. I can do better."
JERK: "Smart. Let me know if need another pair of eyes to go over the contract."
CONTROL: "Thanks JERK. You're a real pal."
YOU: "You said you had a demo to show us today, though, CONTROL?"
CONTROL: "Yep. This should about wrap it up."
