YOU: "Phew... I had no idea what you were asking me to do when we met up this morning, PAL, but this certainly beats what I thought we'd be getting up to. Probably me paying $5.99 for you to enjoy unlimited waffles or something."
PAL: "Hey, if I'm going to con you into paying for my breakfast, I'll at least make sure you get something out of it."
PAL: "So what do you think, YOU? How'd you like your first taste of the underground?"
YOU: "I'm just relieved I have another chance at this degree."
PAL: "Tomorrow we're going to be moving some equipment from the surface down to Big Flat to set up a camp."
YOU: "A camp? Like to sleep down there?"
PAL: "I'm not sure if LEADER sold this place well enough, but it is BIG. You up for the challenge?"
YOU: "I have no idea if I'm up for it or not. But I have to do it. There's no other choice, so I've got to learn fast and make this my thing."
PAL: "I... was kind of hoping you'd be more enthusiastic than that."
YOU: "This is my enthusiastic face. I am absolutely determined. It doesn't matter how I feel because I've got to absolutely commit myself to this. You watch me. I'll be the best caver you've ever seen, if it means getting my PhD."
PAL: "Haha, okay. I'm convinced."
PAL: "Just... Take care of yourself, alright?"
YOU: "Thanks. I've been sort of running ragged, recently."
PAL: "That scar on your face... It's a burn, isn't it?"
YOU: "Is it that noticeable?"
PAL: "Maybe not to everyone, but, like..."
PAL: "I know you used to do that to yourself when we were teenagers. I just hope you're doing okay."
YOU: "I'll be alright. I'm just stressed at the moment, because, well, my life is falling apart."
PAL: "A&M has decent therapists if you need 'em. Just know you're not alone out there."
YOU: "Thanks, PAL. Really."
