PAL: "-- YOU? Where --"
YOU: "Damn radio."
YOU: "PAL! Come in! There's someone... here."
LEADER: "We can't hear -- "
JERK: "I'm on my way."
YOU: "Oh thank god."

LEADER: "So we're not the first ones here."
PAL: "That doesn't look healthy."
JERK: "Check your air sensors."
PAL: "All good here."

JERK: "Carbide lamp... Hemp rope... That's vintage gear. He's been down here three, maybe four decades."
PAL: "Maybe he was a miner..."
JERK: "We can't rule out that he was here caving just like us, either."
YOU: "What do we do?"
LEADER: "We've set up our camp and YOU found a new branch. Those were our goals for today. We get out of here, now."
YOU: "Right behind you."
