CONTROL: "LEADER, come in. Can you guys -- "
CONTROL: " -- I repeat, can you -- ?"
YOU: "Is she alright?"
LEADER: "Is the radio having issues?"
JERK: "We're deep enough that depending on the density of the rock above us, it could be blocking radio waves. I wouldn't count on the radio at this depth."
YOU: "Is that safe?"
PAL: "CONTROL knows where we don't come up by the end of the day."
YOU: "But, if something happens, she can't send help right away..."
LEADER: "Even if someone does break an arm or something down here, we take care of it ourselves. I'm not willing to risk giving this location away to a rescue team."
YOU: "That, um, seems like you're compromising safety."
JERK: "What we're doing carries intrinsic risk. We can reduce danger but never eliminate it entirely."
JERK: "One of the old caving mottos is 'If in doubt, get out.' If you have doubts about what we're doing here, you need to turn around."
YOU: "I didn't say that, I just meant that - "
PAL: "Hey LEADER, how's this spot look for a base camp? Pretty flat, pretty deep."
LEADER: "Not bad at all."
LEADER: "Take some scans while JERK and I set up the rest of the equipment."
YOU: "What should I be up to?"
LEADER: "Poke around a bit on this level if you can. There ought to be branches out to lower halls from here, and if we can find one, we have a starting point for the next expedition."
YOU: "Okay, roger that."
