YOU: "This is Entry Chasm?"
PAL: "Yup. This is where the cave starts to split off from the old mining shaft."
YOU: "Is it normal that it's this dark? Or is my headlamp not working?"
LEADER: "It's just untouched darkness down here. The light isn't able to penetrate that far, just in a narrow beam ahead. It's one of the unique things about the environment down here."
CONTROL: "Did you guys tell her about the flares?"
PAL: "Oh, yeah YOU, CONTROL found a bunch of magnesium flares from when the College of Mining shut down. They'll keep things nice and bright."
YOU: "You're trusting ME with these? I don't think I should be intrusted with uh, incendiary devices."
JERK: "Then stick to your headlamp. But if you really need to see into the distance, you should know the tools available to you."
JERK: "It's better than stumbling into a pit."
