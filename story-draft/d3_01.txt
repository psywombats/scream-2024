YOU: "PAL! Glad you're here early too."
PAL: "Hey YOU! I was just brewing coffee. I was hoping you'd show this morning."
YOU: "I couldn't sleep. Kept having nightmares."
PAL: "That makes two of us."
YOU: "Really? I remember having to kick you awake on camping trips. When you were younger, you could sleep through a bombing raid."
PAL: "Haha, weird how times change. I think it's just circumstances."
PAL: "I'm starting to regret dragging you into all this. To be honest, I was trying to help you out, but I also had my own reasons for wanting someone I could trust around to - "
LEADER: "Good morning, all."
PAL: "Oh, hey LEADER. Good to see you."
LEADER: "I guess you guys are as anxious to get back down there as I am."
LEADER: "I'll go over the plan once JERK and CONTROL show up, but, we're going to explore the area around the camp today... and bring up the personal effects from the body."
