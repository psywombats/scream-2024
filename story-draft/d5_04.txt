CONTROL: "Hellooo? Anyone read me?"
YOU: "CONTROL! It's YOU! Everyting's falling apart down here."
CONTROL: "I figured. That's why I decided to come in person. LEADER and JERK took off on you, huh?"
YOU: "I think I found LEADER's body, but he - "
YOU: "Wait, how am I talking to you right now?"
CONTROL: "Like I said, I decided I'd come in person. You're entirely within Spelonky's simulation right now, so I figure I'd just patch myself in."
YOU: "But the repeater's range shouldn't..."
CONTROL: "Nah, I'm close enough to radio you normally. I think I'm about 1200 meters down? Don't worry, I'll be there soon."
CONTROL: "And don't worry about LEADER's body. That was just him from the previous meta level. Once you reach the bottom, you'll be able to follow him out of the simulation too."
YOU: "CONTROL, where are you? I'm going to head your way, okay?"
CONTROL: "Just head to the bottom and we'll chat there. Sound good?"
YOU: "No!"
CONTROL: "Looks, there's some tricky abseiling down Giant's Pit here, so I've got to jump off for now. See you soon!"
YOU: "You absolutely insane person. How is she even..."
YOU: "Never mind. I need to get out of here."
