CONTROL: " - anyone? If anyone can hear me, let me know."
YOU: "CONTROL! It's me, YOU. We're at the end range of the repeater so we're setting up camp."
CONTROL: "Nice. The chamber's probably... about 100 meters wide, 20 meter ceiling? About 1500 meters deep?"
YOU: "How'd you know that?"
CONTROL: "Spelonky's churning away. I probably know more about the cave than you do!"
YOU: "Then do you know where PAL is?"
CONTROL: "Still working on that! I need more machines. I'm requesting more server time from the College of Engineering. I'm running out of candles, too."
YOU: "Candles?"
CONTROL: "For the seance. If I'm going to have the AI contact the dead, there's a spiritual element needed too. Normally physical machines can't reach that plane."
YOU: "You're the one pranking us at this point, aren't you?"
CONTROL: "I'm deadly serious. Death is just one meta level below the plane we operate at. There's a few more 'realer' lives in the meta levels above this ours as well."
CONTROL: "All I need is enough energy to turn the generation into a simulation, and then I'll be able to talk to PAL if he really is on the other side."
YOU: "You think he's dead?"
CONTROL: "Hopefully not, but it doesn't hurt to check. If I can't contact him, I'll start looking for him in the real world, one meta level above. He might've found a way to escape our simulation."
YOU: "I think the radio signal must be bad. I'm having a hard time following your train of thought. Have you considered taking a nap or something?"
CONTROL: " - good idea. Dreams are sometimes a way to -- across the meta world. I wonder if I can model - "
YOU: "I think I lost her..."
