CONTROL: "I'm sick of everyone arguing, and I'm sick of sitting around up here tinkering with Spelonky."
YOU: "Still dealing with bugs?"
CONTROL: "I think it's got to be bad data from Bitsy. If the scans are accurate, then you guys are pranking me."
CONTROL: "Like, the cave that Spelonky spits out is total nonsense. The chambers overlap with each other. It's way too deep. It's non-Euclidean garbage and feeding to to Spelonky generates glitchy nightmare hellscapes."
CONTROL: "The cave really does exist, right?"
YOU: "Yes?"
CONTROL: "Okay. If this is some sort of long-term plan from PAL to troll me, I swear I'd murder him. It's not funny."
CONTROL: "If this place is half as mysterious as the data you're bringing back up implies, I want to go down there so badly. Like I literally dream about it."
YOU: "That is, uh, relatable."
CONTROL: "I wonder if it's the spirit of that dead guy that's messing with the scanning equipment. Do you think that could happen?"
YOU: "I'm not exactly an expert in the metaphysical."
CONTROL: "I guess an actual ghost would have something better to do than haunt a LIDAR system. You're right."
YOU: "Thanks?"
