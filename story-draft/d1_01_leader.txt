LEADER: "Hi, YOU. Hope I didn't scare you off."
YOU: "Not at all. This seems like a great opportunity."
LEADER: "It's an opportunity for everyone. Unexplored spaces are special. We're truly priveleged to be the first eyes to witness these places only nature has ever known."
YOU: "I know what you mean. I want to make new discoveries and do original research but it's just such tough going."
LEADER: "You get it."
YOU: "Like, my thesis advisor, Dr. Mehta, she's famous in the herpetology world for discovering over fifteen species of skinks that were previously unknown to science."
YOU: "There's this one family, Trachelypsis, that even hangs from trees by their tails. And she was the first to describe them! I want to pioneer like that."
LEADER: "My hero has a lot of firsts to his name too. Are you familiar with Professor Stejneger? He used to teach here at A&M but he retired a decade ago."
YOU: "I don't know him."
LEADER: "He explored the Bridge Caverns, and mapped the Sandstone Cave System too. Founded the National Caving Society. His story actually got me into caving."
YOU: "Looks like you get to follow in his footsteps, then."
LEADER: "I hope so."
LEADER: "But, to do that, I need your word of honor, alright? You don't tell a word about this cave to anyone outside this room."
YOU: "Okay?"
LEADER: "Unexplored spaces are only unexplored once. And it only takes a few loose words to spoil them."
LEADER: "Just something to keep in mind."
YOU: "I will, then. Sorry."
