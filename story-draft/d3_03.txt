YOU: "Hey! PAL, LEADER. I found him."
PAL: "Good eyes, YOU. I didn't expect that to take this long."
YOU: "Because that's not where he was yesterday! He was right next to camp."
JERK: "Well he didn't get up and walk over there. I'd assume this was a practical joke from PAL but we've been together the whole time."
LEADER: "It looks close enough to me. I think you're just misremembering."
YOU: "I'm not! I swear! He moved!"
JERK: "PAL, help me load his things into the pack."
PAL: "On it."
PAL: "Hey, the guy's got a A&M student ID."
LEADER: "He's a student?"
PAL: "'Was' a student. His name's Paul, and he was class of '76. Looks like back then they wrote this ID things with a typewriter. Very retro."
LEADER: "Let me see that."
LEADER: "Paul Stejneger."
JERK: "He... has the same name as the National Caving Society founder? It's not a common surname. Is there a 'Jr.' or 'Sr.' printed there?"
LEADER: "No. And the photo is..."
JERK: "It matches Professor Stejneger, doesn't it? When was the last time anyone saw him?"
LEADER: "He gave a commencement speech just last year. What is his old ID doing down here with this body? It's..."
JERK: "It's time to go, is what it is. We take this ID and evidence up to CONTROL, and we contact Stejneger."
LEADER: "Never! This is OUR cave. We don't need everyone down here, trampling all over, disturbing the unknown, wrecking our chance..."
JERK: "This pace isn't sustainable. We're getting sloppy, and we're making mistakes. This man died down here. He was recently moved. Until we know the threat, we must be cautious."
LEADER: "I'm overruling you. We can't stop now."
JERK: "We operate via committee. You're not the leader. We vote. YOU, you're not formally a member. PAL, what's your vote?"
YOU: "PAL?"
PAL: "...I want to go deeper."
JERK: "..."
PAL: "I don't think I'll be able to sleep until we get to the bottom of this. Figuratively and literally. Haha."
JERK: "Listen, PAL, LEADER. CONTROL can borrow a radio repeater from the college of engineering. We'll haul it to camp tommorrow, and we'll continue from there."
JERK: "This place is cut off from the rest of the world. It follows its own rules. We need a link with the outside."
LEADER: "Just for today, let's - "
PAL: "Actually, I've changed my vote. JERK's right. Come back tomorrow."
JERK: "Thank you."
LEADER: "Sorry, YOU, but it looks like this wraps things up for today. Let's turn around."
