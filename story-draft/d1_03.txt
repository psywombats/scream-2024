CONTROL: "Hey! YOU! You can hear me?"
YOU: "Oh, hi CONTROL. That's you, right?"
CONTROL: "Yep. Just wanted to check in with you guys. Where you at now?"
PAL: "Just coming down Rocklift now. YOU is learning how to abseil."
YOU: "Abseil?"
PAL: "It's what you're doing now. It's a slow descent via rope. The safety line will catch you if you start falling too fast."
JERK: "Don't go jumping down any pits without us though."
YOU: "Alright. I think I'm getting the hang of it."
CONTROL: "I knew you looked like a natural."
LEADER: "Once you're at the bottom of Rocklift, you'll be at Entry Chasm. Just follow us, and keep heading down."
