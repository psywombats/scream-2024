JERK: "I'm sorry you have to put up with this, YOU. You've been here, what, three days?"
YOU: "Feels longer than that."
JERK: "I know this is a great opportunity for you, but I think PAL oversold it. We should've made very sure what we were getting into before dragging any outsiders into it."
JERK: "LEADER and I aren't amateurs. We've been to the bottom of more than a few very deep mines and caves around here."
JERK: "And there's nothing special at the bottom of these things. There is no great treasure, and nothing worth dying for."
YOU: "I wasn't aware I was risking my life."
JERK: "Everything carries risk. And maybe I'm being overcautious and we're not in mortal danger down there."
JERK: "But this is clearly stressing you out. Don't think I don't notice."
YOU: "Oh I'm just stressed from my research. I've been trying and failing for so long that honestly this opportunity feels like a relief."
JERK: "Then I'm sorry if I misunderstood. I saw that burn on your face, and I may have jumped to conclusions."
YOU: "Well... No, my mental health isn't the greatest."
JERK: "...Mine wasn't for a long time either. I struggled mightily in undergrad. I felt alone, and insufficient, and unworthy of any friends or support."
JERK: "And... I honestly still struggle with relying on others. But you're a good person. You're kind and personable. Don't feel like you're trapped here with us lunatics."
YOU: "Thank you for trusting me. But I'm a lot more persistent than you think, JERK. I know I'm a newbie but I'll help as much as I can. I need this."
