LEADER: "So what'll it be, YOU? You know all about us and the cave now, so you can't back out now, right?"
YOU: "I'll do it. I've got to do it. Thank you so much for the opportunity. I know I'm new but I'll give it everything I've got. And more."
CONTROL: "I love your enthusiasm!"
JERK: "Just don't overdo it."
PAL: "Welcome aboard then."
PAL: "Where do you want to start, exactly, LEADER? We can't go taking her down to the cave right away."
LEADER: "Why not? It's as good a place as any to learn the ropes."
JERK: "The top chamber should be safe enough. And CONTROL should have the layout modeled in Spelonky, so YOU can see a preview."
CONTROL: "Er, Spelonky's on the fritz again. I'm still debugging."
JERK: "I shouldn't have oversold it."
CONTROL: "No I really appreciate that you guys rely on me! I'll have it running tomorrow! YOU can check out the digital version of the cave then!"
PAL: "Or we could head on over today and give her a taste of the real thing."
YOU: "If you think it'll be safe."
LEADER: "We're calling the top two chambers The Rocklift and the Entry Chasm. We know both very well and you shouldn't be in any danger there. The light's decent as well."
YOU: "Lead the way."
CONTROL: "And radio me when you get there! Please! Else I'll get lonely here all day!"
