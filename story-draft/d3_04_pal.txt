YOU: "Hi, PAL. Are you alright?"
PAL: "Sorry, YOU. Just tuckered out. It feels like since we've gotten back, CONTROL keeps getting mad at her laptop, and JERK and LEADER have done nothing but argue."
PAL: "I don't know what there is to argue about. Let's just come back tomorrow and go back down. Simple as that."
YOU: "You're not concerned at all?"
PAL: "Concerned about what? I love caving. It's fantastic. It's thrilling to explore someplace new with my friends. So let's just do that, right?"
PAL: "There's no point in sitting around up here when right now, we could be going back down there, right?"
PAL: "I swear it's like you and I are the only sane ones left."
