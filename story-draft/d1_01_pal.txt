YOU: "I didn't know you were into caving, PAL. When we were kids, you just did track."
PAL: "Track, and then rowing and skiing and bouldering. And backcountry hiking when I was in undergrad. That was a blast."
YOU: "Sounds like you. Every outdoor activity under the sun."
PAL: "So I figured I'd branch out! Try something under the earth instead. Turns out caving is extremely my thing."
YOU: "Well, I'm glad you've found someplace you belong. I'm really nervous. I hope I belong here too. This is basically my last shot at my doctorate."
PAL: "Just take a breath and introduce yourself to everyone. You'll be fine."
