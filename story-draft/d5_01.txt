LEADER: "YOU! Sorry to wake you up."
YOU: "Did something happen?"
LEADER: "No. JERK and I were just eager to get going. I'll be covering the north branch, and JERK's headed around the bend to the Maze Meander."
YOU: "We're splitting up?"
LEADER: "We need to cover more ground."
YOU: "And JERK's okay with this?"
JERK: "It was my idea. So, go on. You follow your path and I'll follow mine. Goodbye."
YOU: "What is WITH him today? Is that even safe?"
LEADER: "I think we're beyond the point where safety is important. Stay in touch via radio. Godspeed."
YOU: "Wait! Why are you both just running off?"
YOU: "CONTROL, come in. CONTROL, it's YOU on the radio. Can you hear me?"
YOU: "Stupid thing..."
YOU: "JERK, LEADER? Are either of you there?"
YOU: "Dammit. Damn damn dammit."
YOU: "Okay, YOU. Focus. You're not a total newbie any more. Just picture yourself holding Froggus YOUsicus. You're fine. You're a doctor. You're famous."
YOU: "That's me, right down there, once I reach the bottom of this cave. Me and PAL, joking around, just like when we were kids. Just a little further to go now."
