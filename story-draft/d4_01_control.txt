CONTROL: "Hey YOU, check it out. I've got AI exploration working in Spelonky."
YOU: "That's... great, but, is that really what we should be worried about right now?"
CONTROL: "I figure it's the best way to find PAL. He clearly went into the cave, right?"
YOU: "How do you know that?"
CONTROL: "Because if I could go myself, I wouldn't want to leave that cave. I'd be there breakfast lunch and dinner. So let's assume PAL's down there."
CONTROL: "I'll run a few hundred million simulations of someone following a random walk down there, and if you average them out, that should take you straight to PAL."
YOU: "Your maps of the inside are that good? I thought last night they were all buggy."
CONTROL: "Oh they still don't make physical sense, but when I was coding last night, I had this revelation: the cave doesn't make physical sense, so the meta-cave doesn't need to either."
YOU: "CONTROL, have you been up all night?"
CONTROL: "I got some great tea from my semester abroad. It's infused with woodworms. It'll keep you going for 24, even 48 hours straight. So I lit up some incense in my room and got coding."
CONTROL: "The generative AI is doing its thing now too. I bet I can predict all the chamber layouts straight to the bottom. I could hand you a map right now. Really."
YOU: "That sounds great and all, but, I thought you were supposed to be contacting Professor Stejneger."
CONTROL: "Oh I did that too. I got him on the phone."
YOU: "He's okay?"
CONTROL: "I told him we found his dead body while caving and he was pretty nonplussed about it."
CONTROL: "Actually he was super positive. I can see why LEADER likes him. He said we should keep following our dreams and not give up on the cave. He was encouraging. Enthusiastically encouraging."
YOU: "I guess that's better than finding out he was dead... But then who is it that we found down there with his ID card?"
CONTROL: "Dunno. I'll ask the AI model once I'm done figuring out where PAL went."
YOU: "Gotcha..."
