YOU: "Hi, I don't think we've met, but my name's - "
JERK: "YOU. PAL mentioned."

JERK: "So you're not used to fieldwork."
YOU: "Not underground, anyway."
JERK: "Then what makes you think you'll do well with us, in a new cave, deep below the earth, where no human has tread before?"
YOU: "I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that serious."
JERK: "Lesson number one is that you need to take things seriously. Evaluate yourself. Really think if you belong here."
JERK: "I'm not trying to be a jerk about this, but if you think working with us is going to be a cakewalk, you need to reconsider, and if you're not cut out for it, turn around before you get too involved."
JERK: "...although LEADER would probably kill you rather than let you walk. He's convinced any outsiders will break the news and he'll loose his scoop. Idiot."
YOU: "I didn't realize you guys, were, um..."
JERK: "He's fine, really. Just don't think LEADER is without shortcomings just because he talks big. That's just ego."
