LEADER: "Come in, CONTROL."
CONTROL: "Oh good, you can still - "
CONTROL: " - thought you'd be out range, but I can still sort of hear - "
JERK: "We're at the max range of even the repeater."
JERK: "Whatever these walls are made of, it's not limestone, or any natural stone that I know of. This is powerful equipment. It should be able to penetrate to the surface."
LEADER: "Then we set up camp here. We leave the repeater here, rest a bit, then search for PAL in earnest."
JERK: "I'll work on the repeater. The battery should last at least a day. I'll let you know when I'm done."
