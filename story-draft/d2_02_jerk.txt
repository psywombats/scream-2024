JERK: "You're nervous."
YOU: "I'm not nervous. I'm just - "
JERK: "You won't stop pacing around and you won't make eye contact."
YOU: "I'm not making eye contact because your headlamp is blinding me."
JERK: "I apologize."
JERK: "I wasn't trying to scare you earlier, and I'm not trying to accuse you of anything now. I am just... not quite sure why LEADER would put his whole expedition in danger to take along a novice like you."
YOU: "You claim you're not trying to accuse me of anything, but, you're being pretty blunt."
YOU: "And, I mean, I guess I'm not an expert caver like you, but, I'm down here with you now, right? I made it this far."
JERK: "True enough."
JERK: "I'm just... bothered by this setup."
JERK: "I'm a scientist, like you. My field is geology. And this cave doesn't quite line up with what I know about geology."
JERK: "I don't understand what the original miners were doing in the upper levels. Stopes usually follow natural ore deposits, but the mines up there were..."
JERK: "And the natural caves down here, limestone shouldn't..."
JERK: "My point is that this the unknown. It's fascinating to me. It should be fascinating to anyone, for obvious reasons, and I understand your enthusiasm."
JERK: "But your presence here makes us all less safe. You, especially, are in danger. The more you appreciate that, the safer you'll be."
YOU: "Thanks. I think."
JERK: "It wasn't anything to thank me about."
JERK: "Now let me get back to this formation here..."
JERK: "...just don't get it. This should be the chance of a lifetime, so why does it feel so ...wrong... down here?"
