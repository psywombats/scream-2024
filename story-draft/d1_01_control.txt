CONTROL: "Hi, YOU. It's nice to meet you. I'm CONTROL."
YOU: "Nice to meet you as well."
CONTROL: "I'm so jealous you'll be going off to explore with LEADER and PAL. You'll take lots of scans for me, right?"
YOU: "Scans?"
CONTROL: "I absolutely need to show you my LIDAR rig. I named her Bitsy, but she's actually pretty heavy to get that far underground. She takes a 3D scan of cave interiors, and I can use those to make maps for my game."
YOU: "Oh, you're a game developer."
CONTROL: "Yep! I used to love climbing when I was a teenager but I kind of fell a lot further than I should and now I mostly climb vicariously through the club, or through videogames and simulations and things like that."
CONTROL: "I'll have to show you Spelonky too. It's my capstone project game for my CS degree. It uses generative AI along with LIDAR scans from real caves to generate ultra-realistic environments. It's like you're right there caving for real!"
YOU: "That sounds really cool. I'd love a demo sometime."
CONTROL: "I can totally do that. Let me get my laptop set up real quick..."
CONTROL: "And um... Are you a Scorpio?"
YOU: "I honestly don't know my starsign. Is that... November?"
CONTROL: "And some of October, too. You just seem like a really resourceful and passionate person, so I figured, Scorpio. My intuition is usually pretty right about things like these."
CONTROL: "Er, I'm rambling. I'll leave you be."
YOU: "It's really fine. I'm just as bad -- I talk peoples' ears off about frogs and lizards the first chance I get."
CONTROL: "Haha, that's so Scorpio."
CONTROL: "Okay, here we go. Spelonky's all loaded up. Ready to take a look?"
YOU: "I'm not great at games, but, sure, let's see."

CONTROL: "Wait, what?"
YOU: "Is that supposed to happen?"
CONTROL: "Must be a glitch. Or Bitsy had a bad scan. I swear I'm better at programming than this!"
YOU: "Probably it's just my bad luck."
CONTROL: "Let me reboot it. Or, wait, maybe you'd be better off just seeing it tomorrow once I have the new scans in."
CONTROL: "Stupid Spelonky... How does that even happen? Stupid stupid stupid."
